# Changelog
This changelog will be updated to follow the guidelines of https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
Since we are in alpha and not yet on PyPI, this will suffice for now:

## [Unreleased]
    High Level API tested. This will be Version 1.0.0 and the first version on PyPI
    With 1.0.0 the development status will be updated to beta and will likely remain in beta (Unless I get enough reports to confirm most lovense toys to be working)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-10
    Introduced High Level API

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-07
    Repository made public. Library is in alpha and not available on PyPI yet
